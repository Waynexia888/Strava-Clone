# Stracker

Stracker is a browser-based application allows runners and cyclists to track their workouts, and connect with other athletes. This application allows users to create and save outdoor workout routes, and view the recent workouts of the athletes that they follow.

The application was built using React/Redux for the frontend and Ruby on Rails for the backend, with PostgreSQL to manage the database. All styling was accomplished with Sass-compiled CSS, and I used the Google Map API for all of my geographic needs.
